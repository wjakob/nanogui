/*
 * This library consists of only three files
 * coro.h, coro.c and LICENSE (and optionally README)
 *
 * It implements what is known as coroutines, in a hopefully
 * portable way.
 *
 * All compiletime symbols must be defined both when including coro.h
 * (using libcoro) as well as when compiling coro.c (the implementation).
 *
 * You can manually specify which flavour you want. If you don't define
 * any of these, libcoro tries to choose a safe and fast default:
 *
 * -DCORO_UCONTEXT
 *
 *    This flavour uses SUSv2's get/set/swap/makecontext functions that
 *    unfortunately only some unices support, and is quite slow.
 *
 * -DCORO_SJLJ
 *
 *    This flavour uses SUSv2's setjmp/longjmp and sigaltstack functions to
 *    do it's job. Coroutine creation is much slower than UCONTEXT, but
 *    context switching is a bit cheaper. It should work on almost all unices.
 *
 * -DCORO_LINUX
 *
 *    CORO_SJLJ variant.
 *    Old GNU/Linux systems (<= glibc-2.1) only work with this implementation
 *    (it is very fast and therefore recommended over other methods, but
 *    doesn't work with anything newer).
 *
 * -DCORO_LOSER
 *
 *    CORO_SJLJ variant.
 *    Microsoft's highly proprietary platform doesn't support sigaltstack, and
 *    this selects a suitable workaround for this platform. It might not work
 *    with your compiler though - it has only been tested with MSVC 6.
 *
 * -DCORO_FIBER
 *
 *    Slower, but probably more portable variant for the Microsoft operating
 *    system, using fibers. Ignores the passed stack and allocates it internally.
 *    Also, due to bugs in cygwin, this does not work with cygwin.
 *
 * -DCORO_IRIX
 *
 *    CORO_SJLJ variant.
 *    For SGI's version of Microsoft's NT ;)
 *
 * -DCORO_ASM
 *
 *    Hand coded assembly, known to work only on a few architectures/ABI:
 *    GCC + arm7/x86/IA32/amd64/x86_64 + GNU/Linux and a few BSDs. Fastest
 *    choice, if it works.
 *
 * -DCORO_PTHREAD
 *
 *    Use the pthread API. You have to provide <pthread.h> and -lpthread.
 *    This is likely the slowest backend, and it also does not support fork(),
 *    so avoid it at all costs.
 *
 * If you define neither of these symbols, coro.h will try to autodetect
 * the best/safest model. To help with the autodetection, you should check
 * (e.g. using autoconf) and define the following symbols: HAVE_UCONTEXT_H
 * / HAVE_SETJMP_H / HAVE_SIGALTSTACK.

/*
 * Changes when the API changes incompatibly.
 * This is ONLY the API version - there is no ABI compatibility between releases.

 * Changes in API version 3:
 * introduced stack management (CORO_STACKALLOC)
